* repo organization
note: one repo per flake

system: flakes for hardware and high-level os configs
technology:
project
team
* ip-factory
- put together combinations of the different scopes to get the machine you want (dev machine, build server, general computing, etc...)
- generally one flake per "module" so they can be used as separate inputs
- a machine is not the same as an ip-factory
** ideological scope
no real nix stuff needed
** hardware/infrastructure/os/system
- nixos configs contained in a flake (note that flake = a set of inputs and outputs)
- configs tied to hardware, so config per hardware setup, perhaps with varying infrastructure? (laptop hyper v, desktop hyper v, old laptop, etc...)
- either different flakes for different hardware, or one flake per "owner" of the hardware, i.e. a flake per kingdom (my machines, vermeer machines, etc...)
** platform/technology/maybe purpose
- haskell flake, python flake, etc... (dev, test, run?)
- perhaps a haskell flake, then sub-flakes for haskell dev and test and run?
** product/project
- my project (dev, test, run?)
- dotfiles
** team/user
- home manager for user
- not sure about team
- dotfiles
